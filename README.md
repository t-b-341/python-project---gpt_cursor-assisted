# python project - gpt assisted
this is a project I had gpt generate to learn sql
start with game.py, which references telemetry.py to collect data, then use sqlite3 to explore the db generated data, and modify visualize.py to see different data, using sql script

requires matplotlib, pygame, and pandas
