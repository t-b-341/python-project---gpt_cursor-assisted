# python project - gpt assisted
this is a project I had gpt generate to learn sql
start with game.py, which references telemetry.py to collect data, then use sqlite3 to explore the db generated data, and modify visualize.py to see different data, using sql script

requires matplotlib, pygame, and pandas

download of sql database is unnecessary, it will be generated with the running of game.py, which runs telemetry.py, which generates game_telemetry.db, which can be visualized with visualize.py

EDIT 1-20-26:
I have started using Cursor to add additional features to the game, in collaboration with LP, A, and others
